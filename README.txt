Urgent updates !
nothing.


Planned updates, be free to start them or pull request !
-precise the pin in the console with a command, not in parameter when bots are created
-graphical app, which be the simpliest possible to use (no console, just a double click to start it)
-select the number of bots sent
-name some bots
-write a more precise documentation
